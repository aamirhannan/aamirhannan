I'm motivated by the challenge of building high-performance, scalable applications that solve real-world problems. As a Full Stack Developer with over two years of experience, I thrive in environments that demand innovation, efficiency, and continuous learning. Optimizing system performance, reducing API response times, and creating seamless user experiences drive my passion for development. 

The opportunity to contribute to a high-impact product, collaborate with talented teams, and shape technology from the ground up excites me. I enjoy tackling complex engineering problems, refining architectures, and implementing best practices that enhance maintainability and scalability. 

Additionally, working in fast-paced environments, such as Llumo AI and my freelance projects, has strengthened my ability to take ownership, iterate quickly, and deliver solutions with real value. Iâ€™m highly motivated by mission-driven teams focused on streamlining industrial operations through cutting-edge solutions.
